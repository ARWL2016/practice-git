####Git Practice Repository 

####Basic Branching 
- `git branch name` - creates a new branch  
- `git checkout name` - switches to that branch   
- `git checkout -b name` - creates and switches    
- `git merge branchname` - merges the named branch into the current branch  
- `git branch -d branchname` - deletes a branch  
- `git push --set-upstream origin add-npm` - adds a branch to origin
